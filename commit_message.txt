fix: Arpeggiator knob interaction and portamento functionality

This commit addresses issues with the Arpeggiator module and confirms portamento functionality:

- **Arpeggiator Knob Interaction Fix:**
  - Corrected the `checkInteraction` and `handleDragInteraction` logic in `modules/Arpeggiator.js` to ensure proper handling of knob and slider values during interaction. This resolves the issue where knob markers disappeared and values were not updated when dragged.

- **Arpeggiator Portamento Implementation:**
  - Implemented a dedicated portamento control within the `Arpeggiator` module.
  - Added `portamentoValue` and `portamentoTime` properties to `Arpeggiator.js`.
  - Modified `triggerStep` to apply `linearRampToValueAtTime` using the configured `portamentoTime`, allowing smooth pitch transitions between arpeggiated notes.
  - Integrated a portamento slider into the Arpeggiator's UI for user control.
  - Ensured `portamentoValue` is correctly saved and loaded with module state.

This completes the requested portamento feature for the Arpeggiator, making it independent of the Keyboard's portamento and fully controllable within its own module.
